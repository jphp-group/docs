Array Type
----------

An array in PHP is actually an ordered map. A map is a type that associates values to keys.
This type is optimized for several different uses; it can be treated as an array, list (vector),
hash table (an implementation of a map), dictionary, collection, stack, queue, and probably more.
As array values can be other arrays, trees and multidimensional arrays are also possible.

Explanation of those data structures is beyond the scope of this manual, but at least one example is
provided for each of them. For more information, look towards the considerable literature that exists
about this broad topic.
